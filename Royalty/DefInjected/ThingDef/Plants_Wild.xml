  <!-- EN: A rare tree with skin-smooth bark and long iridescent leaves. Anima trees develop a unique form of psychic symbiosis with surrounding lifeforms, allowing them to grow in a wide variety of biomes.\n\nTribal peoples have learned to psychically link with anima trees while meditating and draw focus from them. This link is weakened if artificial structures are placed nearby.\n\nMost tribes believe that anima trees are not simply trees, but are rather the physical extremities of a single world spirit. -->
